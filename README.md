UCycle

First thing first, we want to introduce you a new concept of collecting and recycling. This concept is about feedback of the collecting points in order to see when it's the time to empty the bins.

Also we would like to present some cool features like the map with the collecting points on it and the percentage of the collecting bin is used. 
Another feature is the number of emptying/month on a bin in order to increase the density of collecting points in that area.

The tools used for developing this app were JavaScript,HTML,CSS,Python, Google Cloud and Github.

One more useful feature is the user interaction which can help us find out the needs of the community. The location of the user is really important because we created an algorithm that finds the closest collecting point to the user.
We developed a site for the administrative staff from the city hall where they can see more statistics.
